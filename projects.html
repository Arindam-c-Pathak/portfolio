            <p class="mb-4"> This is the latest version and most complete voice assistant bot that I have worked on. This has a front end and functions as an application. Althought the compilation is done separate from the components, it has the capacity to be improved much further. I hope to make it more efficient and light weight application.</p>

            <p class="mb-4"> Removal of console function and textual output, added a Logo to be displayed when the code runs. It is still a simple python code that needs multiple libraries to run instead of being standalone program. To move further, I worked on next version.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Moving on from the Text output based design, This version focused on making it modular, a minimal design that doesn't make it clutter the screen when working. There was addition of a logging function that logs all the errors and the conversations between the user and the bot. There is still a need for the console here, which opens when the code is running. To make sure this isn't required, I moved onto newer version which removed all the need for the console window.</p>

            <p class="mb-4"> Starting the work on a more efficient and complete voice assistant, The first goal was to make a front end for display for the conversation with the bot. There were a lot of changes that could have been implemented here, but that would have removed the overall essence of the application. So, I decided to keep the main essence as it is and move on to a newer version with V1.</p>

            <p class="mb-4"> First major project I worked on at personal level. This project was meant to test the integration of voice commands with different libraries. There are multiple functions in this code that are essentially clutter and repetitive functions. There is no front-end, no visual and no logging functions. This left much room for improvement and can be improved much further. </p>
